1. Name: Andres Lezcano Rodriguez
aflezcanorodriguez@my.waketech.edu

2. My GitHub account shows my projects and contributions to open-source software. I focus on programming and development, with projects ranging from personal to collaborative.

3. The repository contains code for a project focused on [project description]. It includes scripts, configuration files, and documentation to help users and collaborators understand and use the project.

4. I used the command cd to navigate to the directory where I wanted to clone the repository. Then I used the command git clone [repository URL], where [repository URL] is the URL of the repository on GitHub. I waited for the cloning process to complete, which created a local copy of the repository in a new directory. Finally, I used the command cd to navigate into the newly created directory to start working on the project.
